# SoMaker

SoMaker is a revolutionary platform that allows users to create fully interactive Web3 games and challenges using just prompts. Built on **Sonic SVM**, the platform leverages smart contracts to enable seamless game deployment, interaction, and monetization. Our goal is to make game development more accessible to everyone, allowing creators to launch their projects with ease while leveraging the power of blockchain.

## Features
- **AI-Powered Game Creation**: Users can generate Web3 games simply by entering prompts.
- **Sonic SVM Integration**: Games are deployed on **Sonic SVM**, ensuring speed, security, and efficiency.
- **Mainnet & Testnet Support**: Pass `network=testnet` as a parameter in the URL to load testnet data.
- **User-Created Challenges**: Anyone can create challenges and engage the community.
- **Monetization**: Users need **SOL** to launch their games on the Sonic SVM network.
- **Web2 to Web3 Transition**: Our smart contract mimics a traditional database, making it easy for Web2 developers to get started.
